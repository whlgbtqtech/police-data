> The author of [Eskimo](http://eskimo.io) highly recommends
reading [ZAG](http://goo.gl/DPmCWa) and adding an onliness statement here.
After completed, you can delete this blockquote from the Markdown file.

> "What's the one thing that makes your brand both different and compelling?
What makes you the 'only'?  Complete a simple onliness statement.
Add detail by answering what, how, who, where, when, and why."
&ndash; Marty Neumeier

> (e.g. "Eskimo is the only boilerplate for Node.js developers who want
a proven, quick, and easy way to build rapid MVPs in 0-60 days.")

**TODO**: Police-Data is the only &hellip; that &hellip;

# Runs 'build'
gulp

# Run jshint to check syntax of JavaScript files
gulp jshint

# Runs 'clean', 'bower', 'less', 'copy', 'imagemin', 'usemin-css', 'usemin-js', and 'usemin-jade'
gulp build

# Runs 'watch-noapp', running the app with nodemon and livereload
gulp watch

# Runs 'watch-noreload', and starts a livereload server to automatically refresh your browser when changes are done
gulp watch-noapp

# Watches changes to public assets (images, fonts, less/css, js, and jade files) and runs appropriate tasks ('imagemin', 'less'/'usemin-css', 'usemin-js', 'usemin-jade') to parse them
gulp watch-noreload

# Run less to create CSS files
gulp less

# Optimizes and copies images to 'assets/dist/img'
gulp imagemin

Default:

```bash
sudo NODE_ENV=production node app

```bash
sudo NODE_ENV=production node cluster
# kill -s SIGUSR2 %d
```
